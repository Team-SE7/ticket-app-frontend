# TIKET. - Admin Movies Project

This project provides the administrative interface for managing the TIKET. movie catalog.

## Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT:**  Please follow this workflow to ensure code quality and consistency:

1. **Push to `development`:** All new features and changes should be initially pushed to the `development` branch. This allows for testing and review.

2. **Create Pull Requests:** When ready to integrate changes into the main production system, create a pull request from `development` into `main`. 

3. **Main Branch for Production Only:** The `main` branch should **always** reflect the current live production code. Do not push directly to `main`.
